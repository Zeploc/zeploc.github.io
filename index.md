This space brings together my work, ideas, and discoveries. Here you’ll find projects I’ve developed, talks and presentations I’ve shared, as well as resources and insights I’ve gathered along the way. It’s a hub for creative exploration, professional growth, and inspiration, reflecting both what I’ve built and what I’ve found valuable.

*Note: This is a work in progress which I will add to and change over time.*

## Sky Ability System
Basic exposing of various GAS systems to blueprints.

Very rudimentary, but exposes various things like a default actor and character you can inherit from that have the ability system ready to go.
A few helpers with the ability interface to further manipulate tags.

If you want anything else further exposed, feel free to reach out.
